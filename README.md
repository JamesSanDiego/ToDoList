# ToDoList
A simple to do list application that uses PHP, jQuery, MYSQL.

How to use:

User will enter their task in the input text field, and click the add button. The task is then added to the database and populated in the task list below.

If the checkbox is checked, the task will now have a line-through the text meaning that the task is complete. If not, then the task is still active.

A user is able to delete a task using the "x". The task will be transitioned out of the task list and deleted from the database.
